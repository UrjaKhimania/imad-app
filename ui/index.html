       <p>I just now got enrolled in High School, however, I have had a great Middle School experience these past couple of years. I was prosperring both in academics and in social relationships (friendship) at Ranson IB Middle School. I consider myself very fortunate to have had tremendous amount of great, helpful friends, and supportive teachers. At school, I had many classes including ELA(English Language Arts), Math, Science, Social Studiens, CTE (Career and Technical Education), PE (Physical Education) and Spanish, however, as the year progressed, I found myself to have developed huge interests in subjects like math, and computer science. I worked hard throughout the school years to maintain my 4.0 GPA, and to take extra couses to help me build my knowledge to progress in the computer science field.</p>
