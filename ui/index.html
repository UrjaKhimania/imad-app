       <p>I just now got enrolled in High School, however, I have had a great Middle School experience these past couple of years. I was prosperring both in academics and in social relationships (friendship) at Ranson IB Middle School. I consider myself very fortunate to have had tremendous amount of great, helpful friends, and supportive teachers. At school, I had many classes including ELA(English Language Arts), Math, Science, Social Studiens, CTE (Career and Technical Education), PE (Physical Education) and Spanish, however, as the year progressed, I found myself to have developed huge interests in subjects like math, and computer science. I worked hard throughout the school years to maintain my 4.0 GPA, and to take extra couses to help me build my knowledge to progress in the computer science field.</p>

       <p>My parents and all the teachers that I have had so far have honestly been my greatest inspirations, since they were the ones who always knew my potentials and held me to higher standards. They never gave up hope on me despite recognizing my weaknesses and struggles. They always helped me persevere through difficult conditions, and taught me how to follow the right and difficult path, instead of the wrong and easy path. Today, I feel like I am who I am because of them.</p>
